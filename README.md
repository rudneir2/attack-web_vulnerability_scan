# attack-web_vulnerability_scan
simple attack to be executed through kali linux and protected by Azure WAF and Sentinel

## Intro

This instruction is intended to be used in a hackathon exercise which there is an Azure environment with a kali linux attacking three resources: a web app, a windows 10 VM and a windows 2019 server VM.

This specific attack goes straight to the Web App. We are also going to see what happen when this attack goes against two layers of protection: WAF and Sentinel.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure environment with the resources required to execute the attack and the security layers: Kali linux VM, Application GW with WAF enabled and Microsoft Sentinel setup.

DISCLAIMER: This instruction doesn't include how to set up the environment. You may want to review this **LINK**.

## First attack

This first scan for web vulnerabilities will go directly to a web app address. In the case of this exercise that is part of a hackathon exercise, we will scan this address:
- https://owaspdirect-prunoavl6xr2y.azurewebsites.net 

But in your own test, you should have something like this : http://owaspdirect-<deployment guid>.azurewebsites.net (in case you follow the ARM Template recommended through this ** LINK **.

**If you are not using the ARM Template provided in this **link**, you just need to consider your Web App URL, whatever it is.**
  
So, let's go! To run the "web vulnerability scan", we will connect to Kali Linux and run **Nikto**, a command line web application vulnerability scanning tool. It comes with Kali Linux, so you don't have to install it.
