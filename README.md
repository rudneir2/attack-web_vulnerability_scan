# attack-web_vulnerability_scan
simple attack to be executed through kali linux and protected by Azure WAF and Sentinel

## Intro

This instruction is intended to be used in a hackathon exercise which there is an Azure environment with a kali linux attacking three resources: a web app, a windows 10 VM and a windows 2019 server VM.

This specific attack goes straight to the Web App. We are also going to see what happen when this attack goes against two layers of protection: WAF and Sentinel.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure environment with the resources required to execute the attack and the security layers: Kali linux VM, Application GW with WAF enabled and Microsoft Sentinel setup.

DISCLAIMER: This instruction doesn't include how to set up the environment. You may want to review this **LINK**.

## First attack

This first scan for web vulnerabilities will go directly to a web app address. In the case of this exercise that is part of a hackathon exercise, we will scan this address:
- https://owaspdirect-prunoavl6xr2y.azurewebsites.net 

But in your own test, you should have something like this : http://owaspdirect-<deployment guid>.azurewebsites.net (in case you follow the ARM Template recommended through this ** LINK **.

**If you are not using the ARM Template provided in this **link**, you just need to consider your Web App URL, whatever it is.**
  
So, let's go! To run the "web vulnerability scan", we will connect to Kali Linux and run **Nikto**, a command line web application vulnerability scanning tool. It comes with Kali Linux, so you don't have to install it.

Once you open the Terminal with Nikto tool, you will start the scan in the Web App address with that command:
- nikto -h http://owaspdirect-<deployment guid>.azurewebsites.net

in case you want to save the output, you may used that command:
- nikto -h <http://owaspdirect-<deployment guid>.azurewebsites.net> -Save ./fileoutput.htm
   
## Second attack

On the second attack we used the IP address (or URL) from Application Gateway that has a WAF enabled. In this time, the Web App application sits behind the Application Gateway and the WAF.

We will repeat the same command above, however with Application Gateway IP Address. Remember that Web App is behind Application Gateway, so, for the end user, it is like accesing the Web App normally.
- nikto -h 52.249.xxx.xxx

in case you want to save the output, you may used that command:
- nikto -h 52.249.xxx.xxx -Save ./fileoutput.htm
  
**NOTE:** It is out of scope in this article, the instructions to set up Application Gateway and WAF. You may check this **LINK** to check how to set up both Application Gateway and the WAF.

## The Result of our first and second Web Vulnerability scan

When we compare both outputs from Nikto, you may notice that through Application Gateway with WAF we got much less errors and vulnerability scanned and found.

in the left image you may see 4 errors and 123 issues, possibly vulnerabilities found.
in the right image, by using WAF, it was found 0 errors and 3 items reported only as possibly vulnerabilities.
